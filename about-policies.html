      <h3 class="pico-color-pink-500">Preamble</h3>
      <p>After close to 50 years of continuous operation since its original formation as Graaf Data Systems in the late 1970s, Graaf Computer Systems Pty. Ltd., along with its subsidiary of GCom Internet, wound up at the end of the 2025-2026 financial year.</p>
      <p>The gcom.net.au email service is now run by the retired directors of Graaf Computer Systems Pty. Ltd. as a free service exclusively for those users of the gcom.net.au, castlemaine.net, centralvictoria.net and vicmail.net email domains with existing and financially current email accounts as at 15th June, 2026.</p>
      <p>Within this document, gcom.net.au and the gcom.net.au service shall be accepted as interchangeable terms representing the retired directors of Graaf Computer Systems Pty. Ltd. and any other associated entities responsible for the operation of the gcom.net.au email service.</p>


      <h3 class="pico-color-pink-500">Indemnification</h3>
      <p>The gcom.net.au service operates as a non-commercial, free service on a best-effort basis. No Service Level Agreement (SLA) is offered or implied to any extent, and no guarantee or warranty is promised or offered related to service uptime, quality or data integrity.</p>
      <p>The Client agrees to use all gcom.net.au services and facilities at its own risk. To the maximum extent permissible by law, gcom.net.au specifically disclaims all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event, to the maximum extent permissible by law, shall gcom.net.au be liable for any financial loss, or loss of data, or other commercial damage, including but not limited to special, incidental, consequential or other damages. The Client agrees that it shall defend, indemnify, save and hold gcom.net.au harmless from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims, including but not limited to legal fees asserted against gcom.net.au, its officers, its employees, its agents and its customers that may arise or result directly or indirectly from any product or service provided or performed or agreed to be provided or performed.</p>

      <h3 class="pico-color-pink-500">Email and Spam</h3>
      <p>Clients are required to regularly collect and/or remove all email stored in all mailboxes and folders associated with their accounts. The gcom.net.au service will be the sole arbiter in determining violations of this provision.</p>
      <p>Mailbox disk space limits of 200MB apply to all email accounts.</p>
      <p>Email items older than two months will be regularly purged from all folders of all email accounts.</p>
      <p>Email items in Trash, Deleted, Spam and Junk folders will be treated as immediately available for purging.</p>
      <p>The gcom.net.au service takes a zero tolerance approach to the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) or spam over its network, or over any other network by way of any service provided by or associated with gcom.net.au. Very simply, this means that Clients of gcom.net.au may not use or permit others to use its network to transact in UCE, and may not use or permit others to use any external network to transact in UCE by way of any service provided by or associated with gcom.net.au. Violations of this policy carry severe penalties, including termination of service.</p>
      <p>Upon detection or notification of an alleged violation of the spam policy, gcom.net.au will initiate an immediate investigation. During the investigation, gcom.net.au may restrict the Client's access to the network to prevent further violations. If the Client is found to be in violation of the spam policy, gcom.net.au may, at its sole discretion, restrict, suspend or terminate the Client's account. Further, gcom.net.au reserves the right to pursue civil remedies for any costs associated with the investigation of a substantiated policy violation. The gcom.net.au service will notify law enforcement officials if the violation is believed to be a criminal offence.</p>
      <p>Clients who violate this policy agree that they will pay research fees not to exceed AU$220 per hour for each hour or part thereof which gcom.net.au personnel must spend in investigating the matter. Severe violations of this policy will result in the immediate termination of the Client's account and may incur an administrative fee of up to AU$1500.</p>
      <p>We consider UCE or spam to be any email message for which a spam complaint is raised by a message recipient, or a valid SMTP rejection or bounce message is recieved, and where the Client cannot produce proof of double opting in on the part of that recipient.</p>
      <p>Quite simply, to avoid any problems or costs, do not spam from, through, or in connection with your gcom.net.au account.</p>
      <p>The Client may not use any service provided by gcom.net.au as a point of email origin for anything other than low-level email despatch which is not associated in any way with mailing lists.</p>
      <p>A maximum daily email send limit of the greater of 300 email items or 300 email recipients applies to all email accounts.</p>

      <h3 class="pico-color-pink-500">Content and Use</h3>
      <p>All services provided by gcom.net.au may be used for lawful purposes only. Transmission, storage, or presentation of any information, data or material in violation of any Australian federal, state, territory or local law is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, copyrighted material, trademark, intellectual property, material judged to be threatening or obscene, or material protected by trade secret and other statute without proper authorization. The Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless gcom.net.au from any claims resulting from the use of the service which damages the Client or any other party. The gcom.net.au service will be the sole arbiter in determining violations of this provision.</p>
      <p>Pornography and related merchandising is prohibited on all gcom.net.au servers. This includes sites that may imply pornographic content, or links to pornographic content elsewhere. The gcom.net.au service will be the sole arbiter in determining violations of this provision.</p>
      <p>All services provided by gcom.net.au are provided solely for the use of the Client directly. No onselling, leasing or sharing of services, whether or not for profit, is permitted. The gcom.net.au service will be the sole arbiter in determining violations of this provision.</p>

      <h3 class="pico-color-pink-500">Server Abuse</h3>
      <p>For the benefit of all Clients and to maintain a quality service, gcom.net.au reserves the right to suspend any account without any notice if that account is found to be affecting the quality of service for other users. In such an instance it is the Client's responsibility to contact gcom.net.au to formulate a strategy to allow the account to be reactivated. The gcom.net.au service will be the sole arbiter in determining violations of this provision.</p>

      <h3 class="pico-color-pink-500">Staff Abuse</h3>
      <p>Abuse of staff by the Client will not be tolerated via any method of communication or under any circumstances. The gcom.net.au service reserves the right to terminate service to the Client as a result of such abuse. The gcom.net.au service will be the sole arbiter in determining violations of this provision.</p>
